🚀 Project Title & Tagline
---------------------------

**Project Title:** Extend React Challenge
**Tagline:** A coding challenge for Extend front-end candidates to showcase their skills in building a scalable and maintainable React application.

📖 Description
----------------

The Extend React Challenge is a comprehensive project that aims to test the candidate's skills in building a robust and scalable React application. The project is divided into several components, including a reducer, actions, and constants, which work together to manage the state of the application.

The project also includes a store, which is responsible for managing the state of the application. The store uses the Redux library to manage the state, and the React Redux library to connect the React components to the store.

The project is built using React, Redux, and TypeScript, and includes a number of dependencies, including React Router, React Icons, and Webpack.
